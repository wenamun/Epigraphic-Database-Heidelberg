# Pelagios Dialog
The Pelagios Commons project & website (http://commons.pelagios.org/) holds a plethora of information about historical places and items connected to these places. The Epigraphic Database Heidelberg is one of the largest content provider to this network. On the EDH website information from the Pelagios network (via Pleiades ID) is embedded in the inscription detail views, you can open a dialog window which shows links to information about both the place itsself and objects and fotos linkd to this place:

This Javascript function queries the Pelagios API (http://pelagios.org/peripleo/places) for place URIs and displays results in two lists: The first list ("About this place") holds links to corresponding entries in various online gazetteers, the second ("Objects & fotos linked to this place") displays links to digital representations of objects found at the specified place.
