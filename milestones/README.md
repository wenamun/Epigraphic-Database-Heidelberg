# Milestones Visualization
The Epigraphic Database Heidelberg holds more than 1.000 mailestones; these often provide information about distances to ancient Roman settlements or cities. For this application milestones have been georeferenced and distances (both in miles and in leagues) have been extracted & converted into a modern unit (km). Red dots on the map denote milestones, blue dots represent the findspots of league stones. You can filter data for centuries, and draw the distances to a specified settlement as a circle around the findspot of the milestone, so idealiter the ancient settlement should be found near the border of the circle.

This application has been prepared for & presented at the Akademientag 2015 in Berlin (see: http://www.akademienunion.de/veranstaltungen/akademientage/akademientag-2015/). You can find it also online at http://edh-www.adw.uni-heidelberg.de/vis/meilensteine.
